<div class="story">
    <p>I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture,
    <p>but I understand that in the Gothic cathedral of the West,
    <p>the roof is thrust up and up so as to place its pinnacle
    <p>as high in the heavens as possible-and that 
    <p>herein is thought to lie its special beauty.</p>
</div>
     
<div class="story1">
    <p>In the temples of Japan, on the other hand, a roof of heavy 
    <p>tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, spacious shadows 
    <p>created by the eaves the rest of the structure is built.
    <p>Nor is this true only of temples; in the palaces of the
    <p>nobility and the houses of the common people, what first
    <p>strikes the eye is the massive roof of tile or thatch
    <p>and the heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves.</p>
</div>

<div class="story2">
    <p>Even at midday cavernous darkness spreads over all beneath
    <p>the roof's edge, making entryway, doors, walls, and pillars
    <p>all but invisible. The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in,
    <p>Honganji-and the farmhouses of the remote countryside are 
    <p>alike in this respect: like most buildings of the past their 
    <p>roofs give the impression  of possessing far greater weight, 
    <p>height, and surface than all that stands beneath the eaves.</p>
